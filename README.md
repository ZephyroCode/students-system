# Students System

---

This is a project I did as homework for my university.

The teacher asked me to make a program with OOP, and so I thought _"Well, I can use my friend's final project and do it my way..."_

My friend was told to make a stundent system in C++, but let's be honest here: **I DON'T LIKE C++**. So! I decided to make a React App, and make every student to be an instance of a Class.

Then I started making the project...

At first, I was just making the UI elements and testing how they looked. Then I started the code to actually make it work.

It took me about 3 days... maybe? Just coding and testing stuff.

Maybe I could add comments in the code files... just to explain how it works and stuff, y'know?

_Also note that the project is in spanish, at least the UI..._

## Overview

Well, it's basically a student record system... You just register a student and it's saved in an array.

Let's just go what the options are about...

- **"Cargar Estudiante"**: here we write the data of the student and then we add it to the array. If the IDNumber is already in the array, you can't use register it again.
- **"Buscar Estudiante"**: here we type an IDNumber and if the student is found, it shows a card with that student's data. If the student is not found, it will show a card saying that the student was not found. lol
- **"Modificar Estudiante"**: we type an IDNumber to get the student, and if it finds the student, we'll get a menu where we can choose which property to modify.
- **"Eliminar Estudiante"**: basically we type the IDNumber of the student we want to delete from the record, and if it finds the student, it'll ask you if you're sure of deleting that student, and then it's gone.
- **"Mostrar Estudiantes"**: this basically just shows all of the students we register.
